### üõ†Ô∏è [06 - Development Practices](./06-development-practices.md)

**How we build software** - Elixir-native, iterative, REPL-first development.

**Key Topics:**

- **Standard library choices** (Req, Oban/Oban Pro)
- **IEx-first workflow** (REPL before UI)
- **Behaviour-based architecture** (JobBoard behaviour)
- **URL-based auto-routing** (paste any URL, system picks scraper)
- **Iterative development** (manual ‚Üí test ‚Üí automate)
- Code organization patterns
- Testing philosophy
- Migration strategies

### üèóÔ∏è [07 - Scraper Architecture](./07-scraper-architecture.md)

**Quick reference** for the URL-based scraper routing system.

**Key Topics:**

- **Visual architecture diagram**
- **When to use direct calls vs auto-routing**
- **Component breakdown** (Behaviour, Registry, Scraper)
- **Development checklist** for new scrapers
- **Example IEx session** walkthrough
- **Quick reference table**

## Quick Start Guide

If you're new to the project, we recommend reading in this order:

1. **[Glossary](./00-glossary.md)** - Learn key terminology (reference as needed)
2. **[Project Overview](./01-project-overview.md)** - Understand the "why"
3. **[Development Practices](./06-development-practices.md)** - See how we build (IEx-first!)
4. **[Scraper Architecture](./07-scraper-architecture.md)** - Quick reference for scraping
5. **[Job Posting Standards](./02-job-posting-standards.md)** - Learn the data model
6. **[Deduplication Strategy](./03-deduplication-strategy.md)** - Understand the core challenge
7. **[Workflow Orchestration](./05-workflow-orchestration.md)** - See background job architecture
8. **[Next Steps](./04-next-steps.md)** - Detailed implementation roadmap

## Current Phase

**Status:** üî∑ Design & Research Phase

We are currently in the exploratory design phase, focusing on:

- Finalizing the data schema
- Researching deduplication approaches
- Planning the scraping architecture
- No code implementation yet

**Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 1 (Foundation) - Database schema and data models

## Key Design Decisions

### ‚úÖ Decided

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexibility
- **Backend:** Elixir/Phoenix for concurrency and reliability
- **Deduplication:** Multi-stage pipeline (exact ‚Üí near ‚Üí fuzzy)
- **Schema:** Superset design accommodating all sources

### ü§î Under Consideration

- Scraping frequency per source
- ML vs rule-based deduplication
- Historical data retention policy
- Frontend framework choices (React vs LiveView)

### ‚ùì Open Questions

- API vs scraping for LinkedIn
- Monetization strategy
- User authentication approach
- Multi-language support (English + Afrikaans)

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Use clear headers** - Help readers navigate
2. **Include examples** - Code, data, or scenarios
3. **Link between docs** - Create a connected web of information
4. **Update this README** - Keep the overview current
5. **Date major changes** - Add version history if needed
